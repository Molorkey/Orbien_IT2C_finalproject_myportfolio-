				<p id="second">My second cat's name is Ming, and she lives with me. You should avoid getting too close to her because she is incredibly bashful and will most certainly hiss at you for no apparent reason if you do. Following her first encounter with you, she will transform into the most affectionate cat you have ever met. While she will play with you for hours on end before falling asleep on your lap, she will always lick the palms of other people's hands if they are holding her. She is a bold feline who is unafraid of everything and is never terrified of anything. She, like her sister Choco, is likewise a pure black puspin with no markings. I adore my two kitties to pieces they are the reason why my emotional state has remained consistent for the past many years they have assisted me countless times in concentrating on my schoolwork and have even joined me at Google meetups on occasion.</p>
